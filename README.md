# JC3:MP Hijack Prevention
The freeroam gamemode currently allows players to hijack planes and other vehicles from invulnerable players. This will try to prevent players from hijacking invulnerable player's vehicles by hooking the hijack event and setting the current driver of the vehicle back to player being hijacked.

## Installation
Drag and drop `freeroam-hijack` into your `packages` directory of your server installation.
